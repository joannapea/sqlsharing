# Limited Public Preview of SQL-based sharing with Azure Data Share
Welcome to the Public Preview of SQL-based sharing with Azure Data Share. This article describes how to get started with SQL-based sharing. Please ensure that you follow all pre-requisites outlined in the documentation in order to successfully share and receive Azure SQL data!

Firstly, please ensure that you have sent us your Azure Subscription ID(s) for the Azure subscriptions you'd like to share data from and to. This is submitted when signing up for the gated preview, which should have been done by filling out the [sign up form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR0heU5TPS0NOh6Qsb8I9HMFUMkNBM0pSSTJCMTVRRlpQWFc3WTVOU0ZQWC4u).

Next, you would have received an e-mail from the Azure Data Share team informing you that your subscription has been enabled for SQL-based sharing. To understand how this feature works, please read the file [Concepts for SQL-based sharing](concepts-sql-sharing.md). 

To start sharing data from an Azure SQL Database or Azure SQL Data Warehouse, ensure that you follow ALL pre-requisites in [Share your SQL data](share-your-sql-data.md). 

For a data consumer to receive your data directly to an Azure SQL Database or Azure SQL Data Warehouse, ensure that they follow ALL pre-requisites in [Receive SQL Data](receive-sql-data.md).
